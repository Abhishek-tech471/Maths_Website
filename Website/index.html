            <h2>About GLA University, Mathura, UP, INDIA</h2>
            <hr />
            <p>
              GLA University is one of the premier universities in India,
              situated in Northern India. The university was established by our
              present Chancellor, Shri Narayan Das Agrawal in 1998. The
              chancellor envisioned GLA as a quality educational institution to
              serve the higher education needs of the youth of the region and
              beyond. The institute was accorded the status of the university
              under the U.P. State Legislative Act of 2009 (UP Act 21 of 2010).
              Recently the University was accredited with 'A+' grade by NAAC. It
              spread across 110 acres of land and is home to more than 12,000
              students, enrolled in a variety of professional courses. It boasts
              of well-designed and maintained buildings, contemporary
              laboratories, spacious residential complexes, and recreational
              facilities. The facilities of such kind and grandeur make the GLA
              campus one of the best in the region, providing its students an
              ideal environment to hone their skills in an increasingly
              competitive and demanding world. The ubiquity of information
              technology and computer power can be applied in many areas ranging
              from industrial production to everyday. Therefore, it is essential
              to develop better understandings and design methodologies for
              large scale pervasive systems for various domains, and for the
              societal challenges....
